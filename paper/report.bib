abstract = {It is shown that if one can apply some Hamiltonian repeatedly to a few variables at a time one can in general effect any desired unitary time evolution on an arbitrarily large number of variables. As a result, almost any quantum logic gate with two or more inputs is computationally universal in that copies of the gate can be “wired together” to effect any desired logic circuit, and to perform any desired unitary transformation on a set of quantum variables.},

@article{Fowler2004,
abstract = {We present a method for constructing optimal fault-tolerant approximations of arbitrary unitary gates using an arbtrary discrete universal gate set. The method presented is numerical and scales exponentially with the number of gates used in the approximation, however, for the specific case of arbitrary single-qubit gates and the fault-tolerant gates permitted by the 7-qubit Steane code, it is shown that the longest practical gates sequences can be found. We also analyse the practicality of the fault-tolerant approximations of the phase rotation gates used in Shor's algorithm and find that simple non-fault-tolerant phase rotations are more robust for realistic error rates. A general scaling law of how rapidly these fault-tolerant approximations converge to arbitrary single-qubit gates is also determined.},

@article{Dawson2005,
abstract = {This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in the form of an efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary single-qubit gate into a sequence of gates from a fixed and finite set. The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of \$\backslash pi / 2\^{}k\$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-\{$\backslash$sc not\}, and \$\backslash pi / 8\$ gates. The algorithm runs in \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{2.71\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ time, and produces as output a sequence of \$O(\backslash log\^{}\{3.97\}(1/\backslash epsilon))\$ quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within \$\backslash epsilon > 0\$. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from \$SU(d)\$.},

@article{Harrow2002,
abstract = {Quantum compiling addresses the problem of approximating an arbitrary quantum gate with a string of gates drawn from a particular finite set. It has been shown that this is possible for almost all choices of base sets and furthermore that the number of gates required for precision epsilon is only polynomial in log 1/epsilon. Here we prove that using certain sets of base gates quantum compiling requires a string length that is linear in log 1/epsilon, a result which matches the lower bound from counting volume up to constant factor.},
