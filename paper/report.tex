\section{Abstract}

Quantum compiling is the translation of a high-level description of a quantum
algorithm into a sequence of low-level, universal instructions that can be
efficiently run on actual hardware. One of the central results of quantum
computing is the Solovay-Kitaev theorem, which tells us that such quantum
compiling can be efficiently done in theory. However, in practice, the
multiplicative constants of Solovay-Kitaev may still make it impractical.
One promising solution is the lesser-known Super-Kitaev algorithm, which
can reduce the compile time of a quantum algorithm in exchange for using
more space and running time during execution. I describe my implementation
of both the Solovay-Kitaev and Super-Kitaev algorithms, compare their
resource usage in several simple examples, and discuss future optimizations.

\section{Introduction}

%% As transistor sizes approach atomic scales, not only are they
%% affected by the properties of quantum physics, they can actually exploit
%% these properties to perform useful computation. This new field, called
%% \textit{quantum computing}, offers us many algorithms which are faster
%% than anything known for current computers running on digital logic
%% (which we describe as \textit{classical}). The results that
%% concern us in this project relate to data search based on
%% Grover's algorithm \cite{grover98} which gives us a quadratic
%% speedup over classical search.

Quantum computing is an emerging field which harnesses the latent
computational power of quantum mechanics to solve useful problems.
Since its proposal by Richard Feynman in 1982, through the discovery
of Shor's algorithm in 1994, quantum computing has seen rapid theoretical growth
with subsequent discoveries of efficient algorithms for graph exploration,
solving systems of linear equations, etc.
This has been matched by equal growth on the experimental side, with physical
realizations first with nucl

The rest of this report is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:grover} gives a high-level overview of Grover's
search algorithm.
%Section \ref{sec:related} discusses previously proposed data models and
%addresses their shortcomings as well as answering their objections.
Section \ref{sec:model}
defines our data model for a hybrid quantum-classical
relational database using the novel concept of a quantum RAM.
%We also discuss several alternative models which do \textit{not} work.
Section \ref{sec:sim} presents
some basic classical simulation results of our quantum database.
Section \ref{sec:algs} provides two
efficient quantum algorithms relative to our model that outperform
anything known in the classical world.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclude} concludes the report with limitations
of our approach and future research directions.

%% \section{Related Work}
%% \label{sec:related}

%% The best known bounds for Grover's algorithm on a variety of search
%% problems are given in the project proposal \cite{pham06}.
%% It is worth mentioning two new papers here to address their objections
%% against quantum databases. Both Zalka \cite{zalka99} and
%% Viamontes et al. \cite{vmh04} point out that even with generous
%% assumptions about quantum hardware, current classical databases manage
%% to scale well for realistic datasets, especially with parallel
%% query execution. This is a valid objection, but we will discuss later
%% possible future applications which will push our capabilities to
%% their asymptotic limits, where quantum algorithms may enjoy some
%% success.

%% These authors make two less valid objections.
%% Firstly, that we must take the complexity of the
%% query function $f$ into account of our running time. This incorrectly
%% assumes that we can run $f$ in constant time on a classical machine.
%% Even when a quantum computer operates on a superposition of states in
%% parallel, it is still only performing classical operations which will
%% take comparable resources on \textit{any} machine.
%% Therefore,
%% considering query complexity only is a more fair model.
%% Secondly, most explicit databases usually don't contain all $2^n$ possible 
%% items in their address space. However, we can deal with
%% arbitrary relations using a quantum RAM to build a true quantum database
%% as described in the next section, although at the cost of making
%% assumptions about future quantum hardware.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

Any practical model of quantum computation
must involve a quantum-classical \textit{hybrid} as
discussed in \cite{oemer00}. Such a
computer is under deterministic control and has access to both classical
features (hard drives, user interfaces, processors)
as well as quantum resources (qubits and
unitary operations).
% which it can
%use at appropriate times to increase its efficiency.

%There are two possible data models under which we can run quantum
%algorithms for relational databases.
%Our model uses a classical
%addressing scheme to locate our data.
%In the first model, the data itself
%can consist of arbitrary quantum states.
%Applications include storing intermediate
%states for quantum computation, entangled qubits for cryptographic
%communication, or quantum software. None of these are possible
%classically, so we concern ourselves only with the second model:
%The data itself is also classical but can be encoded into quantum states
%of the computational basis.

In order to build a quantum relational database, we use a
classical addressing/labeling scheme for our states and
encode classical data in orthogonal quantum states of the
computational basis.
%qubits.
Most importantly, it is necessary to
store and access arbitrary data relations. RAMs do this classically by
associated data words with addresses.
%
% with a rectangular grid of cells proportional to the number of
%data words, which is exponential in the width of the address lines.
Because classical algorithms define efficiency assuming constant-time
access to RAMs, it also makes sense to measure quantum algorithms based
on constant-time access to quantum RAM (QRAM).
Formally, a QRAM can be described as
$Q=\{a,d,\textsf{CRAM}:\{0,1\}^a\rightarrow\{0,1\}^d\}$,
where  $a$ is the address width,
$d$ is the data width, and \textsf{CRAM} is an internal classical
RAM with $d2^a$ bits with additional quantum control.
There are $a$ classical address lines
(\textsf{CA}) and $d$ classical data lines (\textsf{CD})
for reading and writing deterministically.
% and we define
%\textsf{CRAM}$\{0,1\}^a \rightarrow \{0,1\}^d$ as a lookup function for this
%data.
In addition, there is a quantum address register $\ket{\textsf{QA}}$
and a quantum data readout register $\ket{\textsf{QD}}$ with respective
widths of $a$ and $a$.

An example of a QRAM is shown in Figure \ref{qram:fig}, with the data lines
taken from the \textsf{CRAM}. Its typical operation follows:
(1) Classical data is written
using \textsf{CD} and \textsf{CA} (not shown). (2) $\ket{\textsf{QA}}$ is
prepared in an equal superposition of all address basis states $\ket{\psi}_a$
and $\ket{\textsf{QD}}$ is
prepared in the zero state $\ket{0}^{\otimes d}$.
(3) A superposition of the data in \textsf{CRAM} is read out in
\textsf{QD}, on which some quantum algorithm can now perform parallel
queries. We use the property of qubit correlation or
\textit{entanglement} to associate a memory address $x$ with the data word
stored in \textsf{CRAM}$(x)$.
The final state of the combined system $\ket{\textsf{QA}}$ and
$\ket{\textsf{QD}}$ becomes an equal superposition $\ket{\phi}$
of addresses and associated data in the current
database state.
We denote the unitary lookup operator $L$ on QRAM $Q$ as
$L\ket{\textsf{CD}}\ket{\psi}_a\ket{0}^{\otimes d} \rightarrow
\ket{\textsf{CD}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^a}}\sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^a}\ket{x}\ket{\textsf{CRAM}(x)} = \ket{\phi}$.

%
Traditionally, Grover's algorithm searches an \textit{implicit database}
of all $2^n$ possible items,
which can be generated in time $O(n)$ time by applying the Hadamard gate
(discrete Fourier transform over $\mathbb{Z}_2$) to each qubit. However,
we can now generalize the steps in Section \ref{sec:grover} for
\textit{explicit databases} stored in QRAM:
(1) Retrieve $\ket{\phi}$.
(2) For $T$ iterations, query $f$ in parallel on the basis
   states of the current state $\ket{\phi'}$ and perform the following two
   substeps:
(2a) Do the same step as before.
(2b) Flip all states about the original database state $\ket{\phi}$.
% using     the operator $(2\ket{\phi}\bra{\phi}-I)O_f$.
(3) Measure the state, which will be marked with high probability.
Using results from \cite{bbbgl98}, the running time of this algorithm
is $O(T)$ which is still $O(\sqrt{N})$ for $t \ll N$. We confirm this
through actual simulations in the next section.

\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:sim}

Basic lookup was simulated using the QCL software by Bernhard
\"Omer \cite{oemer00}, and the number of Grover iterations $T$
were measured versus the number of simulated address bits $a$.
Note that we fix $d=2$
because of the limits of simulation hardware, and the fact that query
complexity in this case is the same for any computer.

The results are plotted on semilog axes in Figure \ref{qsim:fig} to make the
exponential curve easier to fit linearly. The large initial error is
due to rounding errors for small numbers, but afterwards all plots 
converge well.
The lower and upper bounds of the running time are given for at
least 90\% probability of success. Parties interested in the
implementation details of quantum operators are encouraged to download
the source code.\footnote{\texttt{http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ppham/qram-qcl.tar.gz}}

\section{Algorithms}
\label{sec:algs}

The basic Grover algorithm performs the relational select operation.
Many other classical operations can be implemented using different
query functions. In this section, we present efficient quantum
algorithms for subset search and nearest neighbors, with running times
and data structure space in Table \ref{alg:tab}. We consider query time for
both classical and quantum cases, but memory accesses to RAM/QRAM are
considered constant. These algorithms assume that tables can fit
entirely in main memory; when this is not the case, the disk I/O of
the quantum solution never exceeds that of the classical solution.
%A brief sketch of each algorithm and a definition of symbols is given
%in each of the following two subsections.

Because Grover search is a probabilistic algorithm, it can be
repeated $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ times independently to get an
exponentially small error $\epsilon$. Whether this justifies the
quadratic speedup (or less) in these cases is up for debate, since
many classical randomized algorithms are likewise encumbered.

%However, there are likely to be future database algorithms with a 
%greater speedup for which this overhead is justified.

%% \subsection{Join}
%% For simplicity, assume we wish to join two tables, $R$ and $S$,
%% of comparable size $N$ where each tuple in $R$ joins with exactly one tuple
%% in $S$. a join produces a
%% new table with a tuple for every pair of tuples in $R$ and $S$ that have
%% the same value for the some specified join fields. Classically, the
%% best algorithms either hash or sort one table and then traverse the
%% other table in time $O(N\log{N})$. Quantumly, we can create a tensor
%% product (in this case, essentially a Cartesian product) between $R$ and
%% $S$ by retrieving $R$ and $S$ separately from our QRAM, moving then to
%% separate registers, and then concatenating them in time $O(N)$ to
%% produce a new table of size $O(N^2)$.
%% Note that in each new tuple, the join fields of $R$ and $S$ are
%% duplicated. Our query function returns $\ket{1}$ if the values in these
%% duplicate columns are the same and $\ket{0}$ otherwise. Performing
%% Grover search then yields running time $O(\sqrt{N^2}) + O(N) = O(N)$.

\subsection{Subset Search}

Given a table of items with foreign keys into another table of group IDs,
the problem of subset search is to find all groups which contain a
particular subset of items. Call the total number of different group IDs
$g$ and the size of the query subset
$k$. Then the best known classical algorithm maintains a $g$-bit vector
for each of $N$ items and subset search is performed by ANDing together the
appropriate $k$ vectors.
A quantum algorithm also makes use of bit vectors, but it retrieves a
superposition of the $k$ vectors and checks the $g$ desired bits on
them in parallel. Performing Grover search on these $k$ states to find
the $t$ answers then takes $O(g\sqrt{kt})$ time and the same classical
space. If $t=k$, then there is no quantum speedup, as expected.

\subsection{Nearest Neighbor}

Given a database of $N$ tuples with binary fields representing features,
we can represent $d$ Boolean dimensions 
 with a $d$-bit vector and define the
feature distance between two tuples as the Hamming distance of these vectors.
The best known classical algorithm \cite{indyk04} is randomized
and also has an overhead for driving down error. The quantum algorithm
as usual retrieves a superposition of the $N$ tuples and queries the
Hamming distance to a given input in $O(d)$ time in parallel and stores
it in a scratch register. Then it uses Grover search on this scratch
register to find the minimum in $O(\sqrt{N})$
\cite{durr96} for a total time of $O(d\sqrt{N})$.
In this case, the comparison is not clear between $\log{N}/\epsilon^2$ on
the classical side and $\log(1/\epsilon)\sqrt{N}$ on the quantum side, but
a quantum insertion is a simple $O(1)$ write with no extra storage overhead.

\section{Conclusion and Future Extensions}
\label{sec:conclude}

In this work, we have adapted one of the central results of quantum
computing, Grover's search algorithm, to two prominent problems of
classical relational databases. In doing so, we have designed the novel
concept of a quantum RAM and simulated a generalized quantum search
algorithm successfully.
However, this work is primarily limited by the current experimental
nature of quantum computers, and it is uncertain whether an efficient
QRAM can ever be built. In the theoretical realm, however, quantum search
can immediately be extended to aggregate counting functions, duplicate
elimination, and query size estimation.
Much more simulation work remains to be done using larger,
more realistic datasets, especially for the theoretical
problems studied in this project.
In conclusion, the author wishes to thank Dave Bacon for helpful advice
during the
course of this project.
